# Overview

This project has a goal of contributing to the knowledge base around payments fraud.
I believe the following components are necessary.

## Dataset Balancing

Virtually all Fraud datasets are unbalanced.
I will need to spend some time evaluating how to take this into account in the analysis.

## Exploratory Modelling

I will do a few "simpler" models to try to understand which variables are important.

### Regression Model

The first model I wish to build is a logistic regression model.
The desired outcome for this would be to understand which variables in combination with one another have impact on the model.

### Principal Component Analysis, Exploratory Component Analysis

These methods will create higher level categories to help understand different kinds of transactions.
This will help understand how different transactions are from one another.

## More complex model

I would like to use a more sophisticated method to evaluate fraud.

Things that are interesting to me:
1. Neural Networks
2. Inductive Logic Programming
